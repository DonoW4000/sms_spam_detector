# sms_spam_detector

Iâ€™ll be refactoring my SMS text classification code into a function that builds a linear Support Vector Classification (SVC) model. Once the model is created and trained, I'll set up a Gradio app to host it. This will let users input text messages and get feedback on whether the message is classified as spam or not, based on the model's predictions. The app will give users an easy way to test the system interactively.
